Assignment

Before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

* Refactor the code. Remember that we are optimizing for readability and want to see you using functions in a good way.  
* The player should be given an option of languages. The code for supporting this should be in a separate file.
* Do not accept the same letter twice.
* Fix the glitch in the graphics.
* There is a bug that makes it so that the final drawing is not displayed, fix this. 
* Extend the number of attempts the player has to guess the word (remember that extends implies after the existing, and that each attempt is associated with a graphical representation)
* Retrieve the list of possible words at startup from the file words.txt. You may have to move the file to a suitable folder. 
(tip: readFileSync for JS, open / read for Python ) )
